# About

My name is Geert and I'm the author of this blog.

The basis for the theme used on this site is [hugo-theme-hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend). It features:


- **light/dark mode**, depending on your preferences
- great reading experience thanks to [**Inter UI font**](https://rsms.me/inter/), made by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)
- nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
